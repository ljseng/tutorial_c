# DEBUG PRINT

A simple project to streamline the process of printing debug messages in your code. This project encapsulates your debugging statement in a single macro, making your debugging experience smoother and more productive. With this macro, you can:

- Print debug messages with automatic newline characters.
- Enhance code readability by using consistent debugging statement.

## Project Structure

The core lies in the `debug_print.h` header file, which defines the macro for streamlined debugging. The accompanying `main.c` serves as a driver code that demonstrates how to use this powerful tool effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **gcc**: The GNU Compiler Collection, which is essential for compiling C code.
- **make**: A build automation tool that simplifies the compilation process.

## Building and Usage

### Building

To compile the source code, use the following command. The compiled binary will be put in the `bin` folder.

```bash
make
``````

### Running

To execute the compiled binary, use the following command.

```bash
make run
``````

### Cleaning

To remove the compiled binary, use the following command.

```bash
make clean
``````
